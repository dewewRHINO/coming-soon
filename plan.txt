Steps 1 and 2 done
Steps 3 - 6 (The Plan!):
  So basically I have to make this website. How you may ask? That is a
  good question..... but here is what I plan to do!

  1.) Figure out headers and paragraphs, order the logos first, not the
  right hand photo.
  2.) Make the CSS folder and install bootstrap so I do not die
    a.) Put specified fonts and override bootstrap when necessary
  3.) Put contents into divs and add the picture to the right hand
  side
    a.) Put content into 4 different divs, organize them and manipulate their sizes
    so that it looks good :0
    b.) First div is the Base Appareal
    c.) Second div is the WERE COMING soon
    d.) Third div is the Description
    e.) Fourth div is the email
    f.) Split into two bigger divs that take up the whole hieght and split
    the page 60 percent for the information and the image to the left
    40 percent of the page
  4.) Figure out styles and backgrounds
  5.) Make the website responsive.
